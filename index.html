    <h1>Making responsive Website</h1>
    <p><em>Media Queries</em> are a great way to ensure that all users of a website have a good experence.
         The media queries - literally '@media' as if it's asking the media a question - will ask the browser
        about it's current dimensions. The browser will tell our CSS what size itis, and the CSS will rearrange 
        and re-display based on those parameters. My goal here is to show to use the wueries, but all we want from 
        you right this stuff is going on in the background of things like Bootstrap.</p>
